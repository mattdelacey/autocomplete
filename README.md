# Autocomplete with ElasticSearch

## What is here?

Simple Angular Application that can be deployed and run on both web and mobile (iOS and Android)

- Users can go to the search tab, start typing, and Product names will appear with low latency
- Search uses the _suggest endpoint for elasticsearch running on Google Cloud Platform

To run, clone this repo and then run: npm install

Then, you should be able to either run ionic serve or ionic corodova build ios or ionic cordova build android and install on a device.
