# Autocomplete with ElasticSearch

## What is here?

Simple Angular Application that can be deployed and run on both web and mobile (iOS and Android)

- Users can go to the search tab, start typing, and Product names will appear with low latency
- Customization of all menu items in terms of name and icon is all possible, but the tabs require more manual intervention right now.

To run, clone this repo and then run: npm install

Then, you should be able to either run ionic serve or ionic corodova build ios or ionic cordova build android and install on a device.
